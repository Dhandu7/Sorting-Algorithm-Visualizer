# Pygame Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This repository contains a Pygame-based application for visualizing various sorting algorithms. It allows you to see how different sorting algorithms sort arrays through graphical representation.

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
- Ability to reset the data, track execution time, and show python code for the selected algorithm

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Pygame library installed.

You can install Pygame using pip:
pip install pygame

## Running the Application

To run the program, navigate to the source folder and run the command:
